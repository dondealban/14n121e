**CLIMATE-RELEVANT MODERNISATION OF THE NATIONAL FOREST POLICY AND PILOTING REDD+ MEASURES IN THE PHILIPPINES (2011–2014).**

Climate-relevant Modernisation of the National Forest Policy and Piloting REDD+ Measures in the Philippines.

The ALOS K&C Philippines team is composed of representatives from Fauna & Flora International, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, and the Department of Geodetic Engineering of the University of the Philippines. Other collaborators include staff of the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority and the Forest Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Under the ALOS K&C Initiative Phase 3, the Philippines project aimed to achieve the following:

1. Establishing baseline forest carbon stocks;
2. Piloting of forest carbon methods using ALOS/PALSAR data to monitor land cover changes; and
3. Determining deforestation rates using ALOS/PALSAR data.

The Philippines ALOS K&C Project intended to support the REDD+ readiness initiatives in three sub-national demonstration sites, including: (1) Southern Leyte province; (2) Victoria-Anepahan mountain range, province of Palawan; and (3) Gen Nakar municipality, province of Quezon.
