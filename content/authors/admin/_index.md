I am a geographer and engineer interested in understanding land change as coupled human-natural systems, with an aim to develop solutions to address sustainability challenges in Southeast Asia.

Presently, I am the Global Head of Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis at [ClearWind](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clearwindearth), a Singapore-based company developing nature-based carbon projects across Southeast Asia. 

Previously, I was a senior researcher at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (2016–2023), most notably at the [Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs/jose-don-de-alban/) where I led, managed, and coordinated its regional Carbon Market Integrity R&D programme in Southeast Asia.

Prior to joining academia (c. 2000–2015), I was a conservation practitioner-scientist and worked with international, national, and local conservation organisations including [Fauna & Flora International](https://www.fauna-flora.org), [Foundation for the Philippine Environment](https://fpe.ph), and [Haribon Foundation](https://haribon.org.ph).

I am a member of the [Global Land Programme](https://glp.earth/users/jose-don-de-alban), [Biodiversity Conservation Society of the Philippines](http://www.biodiversity.ph), [Philippine Geographical Society](https://phgeographicalsociety.org), and a science team member of the [ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/kyoto/kyoto_index.htm), an international research collaboration led by [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/a/en/activity/kc_e.htm).
