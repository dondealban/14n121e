I am a geographer and engineer interested in understanding land change as coupled human-natural systems, with an aim to develop solutions to address sustainability challenges in Southeast Asia.

Presently, I am a senior researcher at the [Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs/jose-don-de-alban/) of the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg). I lead, manage, and coordinate the Centre's regional carbon measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (M & MRV) R&D programme in Southeast Asia, including projects applying remote sensing and geospatial technologies and techniques for [nature-based solutions](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs/research/overview/). Between 2016–mid-2021, I was a researcher at the [Applied Plant Ecology Lab](https://www.appliedplantecology.org), also at the National University of Singapore, studying the processes and impacts—both biophysical and socio-econo-political—of the profound agricultural transformation of tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia by integrating various quantitative and qualitative approaches in geographical research studies. 

Prior to joining academia (c. 2000–2015), I was a conservation practitioner-scientist and worked with international, national, and local conservation organisations including [Fauna & Flora International](https://www.fauna-flora.org), [Foundation for the Philippine Environment](https://fpe.ph), and [Haribon Foundation](https://haribon.org.ph).

I am a member of the [Global Land Programme](https://glp.earth/users/jose-don-de-alban), [Biodiversity Conservation Society of the Philippines](http://www.biodiversity.ph), [Philippine Geographical Society](https://phgeographicalsociety.org), and a science team member of the [ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/kyoto/kyoto_index.htm), an international research collaboration led by [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/a/en/activity/kc_e.htm).
