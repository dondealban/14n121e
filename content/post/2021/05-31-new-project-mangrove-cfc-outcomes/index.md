title: 'New project on assessing outcomes in certified community mangrove forests.'
---
This month, we started a new research project that aims to track community forest cover in certified community mangrove forests in Myanmar and provide information that may improve the process of certification and the policies supporting these forestland tenure activities.

The project is a research collaboration between our lab at the National University of Singapore, [Landesa](https://www.landesa.org), and The Center for People and Forests (or [RECOFTC](https://www.recoftc.org)).
