Last quarter, we published a paper ['Effects of climate change and land cover on the distributions of a critical tree family in the Philippines'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79491-9) in the journal Scientific Reports. Our study was featured in two national broadsheet newspapers, by the Straits Times in Singapore and the the Philippine Daily Inquirer in the Philippines, both of which I am pleased to share in this post.

First, here's the link to the [online article](https://technology.inquirer.net/108340/climate-change-adversely-affects-philippine-hardwood-trees-study) in the Philippine Daily Inquirer by Ms Jhesset Enano. And second, here's the copy of the article in The Straits Times bby Ms Audrey Tan (link to [online article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/s-e-asias-forest-giants-face-uncertain-future-study?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) for subscribers):

As of writing this post, the [Altmetrics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79491-9/metrics) score of the paper is at 50 with 3733 accesses, and lo and behold, one citation. You can tell that I am savouring this over-the-moon post-publication feeling.
