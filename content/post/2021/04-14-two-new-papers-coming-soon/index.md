title: 'Two new papers coming soon.'
---
I have two new papers coming out soon. First, about the drivers and mechanisms of forest change in the Himalayas led by a friend and colleague, Akash Verma, to be published in Global Environmental Change; and second, about the conservation required beyond the existing protected area network to improve species and habitat representation in a global biodiversity hotspot led by yours truly to be published in Biological Conservation.

Watch this space!
