title: 'Random notes from edX Synthetic Aperture Radar: Hazards course.'
---
I thought I'd put together some random notes while learning from the Synthetic Aperture Radar: Hazards course taught by Dr Franz Meyer, the Chief Scientist of the Alaska Satellite Facility and Professor of Radar Remote Sensing at the Geophysical Institute at University of Alaska Fairbanks, through edX's massive open online course platform.

My main motivation for enrolling in the online course was to refresh my foundational knowledge and understanding of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and enhance my skills on utilising more advanced techniques including interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR), and SAR tomographyâ€”all of which are quite very exciting technologies to employ in my research.

To anyone else other than myself reading this post however, these notes might not really make any cohesive sense but I suppose each snippet would still be a valuable nugget of information for learning about synthetic aperture radar.
