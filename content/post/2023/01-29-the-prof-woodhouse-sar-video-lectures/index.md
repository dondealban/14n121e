Here's a treasure trove of video lectures by Prof Iain Woodhouse, Professor of Applied Earth Observation at the University of Edinburgh and Co-founder of Carbomap Ltd, Econometrica, and Earth Blox, on understanding and using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The video lectures were organised online by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee on November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Day 1: Brief history, fundamentals of electromagentic waves, polarisation, combination of waves, some core principles
{{< youtube e4vCYcMbFyg >}}<br/>

Take-home messages:

- Radar remote sensing is all about the time dimension


#### Day 2: How microwaves interact with surface features, surface roughness, moisture content, vegetation
{{< youtube NGkICs3hApg >}}<br/>

Take-home messages:

- Incidence angle is important! Radar backscatter changes with incidence angle
- 'Roughness' is a matter of scale relative to the wavelength 



#### Day 3: How radar builds an image, data properties, unique challenges of radar, speckle,  geometric distortions

#### Day 4: Practical: how to find data; Split into two groups: SNAP practical and EO browser practical
