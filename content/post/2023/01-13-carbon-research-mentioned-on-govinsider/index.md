I am happy to share a recent [news article on GovInsider](https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/How-the-Singapore-Land-Authority-is-raising-the-bar-for-climate-research-using-precise-spatial-data) that mentioned our ongoing [research collaboration](https://www.sla.gov.sg/articles/press-releases/2022/singapore-land-authority-and-national-university-of-singapore-ink-new-partnership-to-harness-geospatial-technologies-for-carbon-estimation-research-in-singapore-s-forest) between the [Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions](https://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs/) and the [Singapore Land Authority](https://www.sla.gov.sg/) on improving estimates of the amount of carbon for different forest ecosystems in Singapore using field measurements combined with advanced remote sensing technologies, including Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).

I was also quoted based from our interview for the article with Ms Rachel Teng, the author and a reporter and conference producer at GovInsider:

> While scientists do possess global estimates of carbon sequestrations, the margins of error in Southeast Asia are significantly large, which may have implications on the reliability of carbon markets on this side of the globe. “If you have large uncertainties for carbon estimates in Southeast Asia, this also translates into investor and price uncertainties,” says Dr Jose Don Tungol De Alban, a researcher at CNCS.
