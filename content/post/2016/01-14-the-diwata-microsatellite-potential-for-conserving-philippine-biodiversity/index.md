title: 'The Diwata microsatellite and its potential for conserving Philippine biodiversity.'
---
News about Diwata, the first microsatellite to be launched this year as part of the Philippines' space programme, has been making the rounds over the internet again the past couple of weeks. Last January 12th, Diwata was finally turned over to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, eventually leading to its deployment from the International Space Station this April. Many are excited, especially Filipinos, including me, to see this endeavour finally come to fruition. At last, the Philippines will finally venture into space.

My interest in Diwata is not only because it marks the beginning of a national space programme, which offers tremendous potential for growth and development, and of course, having that sense of ownership and national pride. While there are many applications envisioned from using Diwata's imagery, I am keenly interested in Diwata because of its potential capabilities in support of conserving Philippine biodiversity, of protecting its species many of which are in fact found nowhere else in the world, and of managing their habitats, such as forests and coastal ecosystems. But before we dive into the reasons why I think Diwata shows promise, let me take you through some bits of information to get to know more about this microsatellite.

### Introducing Diwata.

We know that Diwata, or PHL-Microsat-1, is one of two microsatellites that the Philippines will be launching in 2016 and in 2017 [2]. Diwata falls under the category of microsatellites owing to its dimensions of 55cm x 35 cm x 50cm with a 50kg mass [3]. It is the first Philippine earth observation microsatellite and the first one to be designed and assembled by Filipinos as part of the national government's three-year (2015-2017) Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite Programme, implemented in partnership with Japanese counterparts, Hokkaido University and Tohoku University.

Composed of five project components [4], the development of the microsatellite forms the first component of the entire programme. The second involves the establishment of an operational ground receiving station, the Philippine Earth Data Resource and Observation (PEDRO) Centre in Subic Bay Freeport, Zambales, supported by the third component on the development of the data processing, archiving, and distribution subsystem for the ground receiving station. Fourth, the calibration and validation of the remote sensing instruments, or the Cal/Val phase, is intended to calibrate, test, and improve the measurement accuracy, models, and algorithms for the science data products during pre- and post-launch. And finally, the last component deals with the development of remote sensing data products that can be used for different applications.

Among the practical uses envisaged as a result of the microsatellite programme are improving weather forecasting; better disaster risk management and emergency response; periodic monitoring of agricultural production, forest and land cover change, and ocean productivity; and contributing to matters of national security [2,3].

### Potential for conserving biodiversity.

Diwata will follow a low earth, sun-synchronous orbit in space at approximately 480 km above the earth. It is expected to pass over the Philippines four times per day with an average of six minutes per pass, capturing around 900 images in each pass [3]. It consists of the following payloads or instruments, namely [2,5]:

[a] *High Precision Telescope (HPT).* The HPT instrument will capture very high-resolution images at 3m with each image having a scene size of 1.9km x 1.4km. The images will consist of four bands, particularly the blue, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths. It will be used for damage assessment from natural hazards such as floods and earthquakes, and potentially useful for monitoring urban sprawl and planning urban development.

[b] *Spaceborne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF).* With a medium-resolution of 80m, the SMI instrument will capture images with scene sizes of 52km x 39km, which will be used for monitoring ocean productivity and changes in vegetation. The instrument also features two optical filters, one for the visible spectrum (420-700nm), and the other for the near- and mid-infrared spectrum (650-1050nm). Another sensor will capture data at the extreme ultraviolet spectrum (10-20nm).

[c] *Wide Field Camera (WFC).* The WFC will capture panchromatic images with a 7km spatial resolution, which will be used to observe cloud patterns and weather disturbances, and estimate typhoon intensity.

[d] *Middle Field Camera (MFC).* With a spatial resolution of 185m, the MFC is an engineering payload that will assist in geolocating the images captured by the SMI and HPT instruments.

Both the SMI and HPT are potentially capable of producing data products that can be used for quantifying and modelling biodiversity. And when I say 'potentially' I mean it may be able to provide these products given its specs. Similar to the capabilities of NASA's MODIS or Landsat sensors, the SMI instrument may be used for detecting boundaries of land, clouds, and aerosols; and for quantifying ocean colour, phytoplankton, and biogeochemical properties.
