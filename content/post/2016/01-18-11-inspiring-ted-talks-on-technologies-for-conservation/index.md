title: '11 inspiring TED talks on technologies for conservation.'
---
Geospatial technology refers to equipment used in visualisation, measurement, and analysis of the earth's features, typically involving such systems as remote sensing, global positioning systems for tracking and navigation, and geographic information systems to put spatial data together for analysis and decision support. Remote sensing technologies, in its broadest sense, involve data acquisition by hand-held and fixed ground-based sensors such as camera traps and acoustic recorders, and sensors on airplanes and satellites [1].

In this post, let me share eleven of my favourite interesting TED Talks about conservation efforts around the world that made use of geospatial technologies, in either conventional or unusual and exciting ways, and about technologies, both old and new, that tell compelling stories or show potential for conserving biodiversity. (Excerpts lifted from the individual TED Talks pages.)<br/>

### Yann Arthus-Bertrand. [2009]. A wide-angle view of fragile Earth.

In this image-filled talk, [Yann Arthus-Bertrand](http://www.yannarthusbertrand.org/en/home) displays his three most recent projects on humanity and our habitat â€” stunning aerial photographs in his series "The Earth From Above," personal interviews from around the globe featured in his web project "6 billion Others," and his movie, "[Home](http://youtu.be/jqxENMKaeCU?hd=1)," which documents human impact on the environment through breathtaking video.
