title: 'Linking technology for conservation: a personal journey.'
---
I read a recently published review paper by Pimm et al. regarding emerging technologies to conserve biodiversity [1] in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution. It provided a good summary of the challenges and opportunities that came with new technologies that have been improving conservation efforts and helping to solve species and habitat loss. The authors posed outstanding questions, of which some were very relevant to my own work on conservation geomatics, most notably on combining remote sensing of environments with species distribution data and photographs of species that would allow rapid responses to threats; broadening outreach to those who collect data on endangered species and ecosystems and sharing the results with them; and filtering large amounts of data relevant for analysing and processing key questions. One of the authors, Professor Zoe Jewell of Duke University, stated [2]:

> New technologies offer enormous potential for wildlife conservation. But we face a broad challenge in harnessing these technologies. We must increase the pool of data collectors, find better ways of managing the resulting huge increase in data generated, and use interdisciplinary approaches to develop creative solutions to meet anticipated future challenges.

It was a timely read that helped me rethink and reflect of the interface of technology and conservation, and of the emerging perspectives I needed to keep in mind as I moved towards the direction I was headed.
