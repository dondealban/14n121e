Almost three weeks have passed since our [paper on historical mangrove change in Myanmar](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab666d) was published in [Environmental Research Letters](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1748-9326). And to be honest, I still feel over the moon knowing that it is my first paper as lead author to be published in a prestigious journal, which got picked up by various news outlets–thanks to the support of our media office at the university–such as [EurekAlert!](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/nuos-mt6030220.php) and [PHYS.org](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-myanmar-mangroves-deforested-years.html).

Moreover, there were several tweets that shared our paper or the press release over Twitterverse, of which the most noteworthy ones were:

From the National University of Singapore:
{{< tweet 1234674805669974017 >}}
{{< tweet 1234665510169497601 >}}

From international and regional news outlets:
{{< tweet 1234841149761818630 >}}
{{< tweet 1234877468936409088 >}}

And from international and Myanmar journalists and writers, and science communicators:
{{< tweet 1235241606250475520 >}}
{{< tweet 1235076179356315649 >}}
{{< tweet 1235339939778306048 >}}

The statistics of the paper rose quickly too: the Altmetrics score is at 75 with 1129 paper downloads as of writing this post. Just let me savour this post-publication feeling for now, which is just over the moon.
