title: 'Learning Open Foris tools (Part 1).'
---
Here's another suite of software tools that land change scientists and geospatial analysts should have in their toolbox: [Open Foris](http://www.openforis.org/home.html).

The suite of Open Foris software tools for environmental monitoring.

Open Foris is a set of free and open-source software tools designed to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting for environmental monitoring such as forest inventories, climate change reporting, socio-economic surveys, biodiversity assessments, land use/cover change assessments, among others [1]. This initiative, resulting from the collaborative efforts of numerous public and private institutions, is hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

At the moment, I am specifically interested in learning [Collect Earth](http://www.openforis.org/tools/collect-earth.html), one of the Open Foris tools that enables data collection through the [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) interface, to streamline my image classification and analysis workflow in [Google Earth Engine](http://www.openforis.org/tools/collect-earth.html). Used in conjunction with Collect, another tool for designing survey forms and managing survey data, bespoke data entry forms can be setup and streamlined with a user-friendly interface, say, for land use/cover change assessments. (Note that there are a few other tools included in the Open Foris suite such as Collect Mobile, Calc, and Geospatial Toolkit, which I have not yet explored but could still be useful and relevant in support of my research in the near future.)

In a nutshell, Collect Earth essentially facilitates the interpretation of high and medium spatial resolution imagery available in Google Earth, Bing Maps, and Google Earth Engine. It simplifies the data entry process in land use/cover change assessments (e.g., identifying regions of interest for classification and analysis), synchronises the view of each sampling point across all three platforms to streamline the process of reviewing satellite imagery, and seamlessly integrates this database of sampling points with Google Earth Engine for wall-to-wall image classification.
