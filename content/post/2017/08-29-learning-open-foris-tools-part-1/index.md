Here's another suite of software tools that land change scientists and geospatial analysts should have in their toolbox: [Open Foris](http://www.openforis.org/home.html).

The suite of Open Foris software tools for environmental monitoring.

Open Foris is a set of free and open-source software tools designed to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting for environmental monitoring such as forest inventories, climate change reporting, socio-economic surveys, biodiversity assessments, land use/cover change assessments, among others [1]. This initiative, resulting from the collaborative efforts of numerous public and private institutions, is hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.
