Here's a quick post just to mention a few updates. First, on publications, two articles in press in *Conservation Biology* journal, which were accepted over the past couple of months; and also two currently in review. Head over to the [Publications](https://dondealban.netlify.app/publication/) page for more details. Most of my pre-occupation this year has been data analysis and modeling, and learning software tools such as Google Earth Engine and LaTeX. If you are interested to know more, please head over to my [GitHub](https://github.com/dondealban) where you can check the data analysis and scripts, and read more about them. And lastly, a new theme for a fresh look, well, just a bit. More soon.
