abstract: I was invited by Prof Janice Ser Huay Lee to give a guest lecture for her students studying Coupled Human and Natural Systems at the Asian School of Environment of the Nanyang Technological University. I shared about my ongoing research on understanding land-system change in Myanmar, as well as scale-up work in mainland Southeast Asia, which was particularly aligned to her course topic for the week on forests and agriculture.
