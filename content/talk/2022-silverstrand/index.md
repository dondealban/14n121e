abstract: I gave a brief research talk on carbon measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (M & MRV) during the [Biodiversity Accelerator+ Programme](https://www.silverstrand.capital/the-biodiversity-accelerator) organised by [Silverstrand Capital](https://www.silverstrand.capital). My talk was part of a series of of lectures by a team of senior researchers from the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, which was capped by an 'Ecosystem Speed Dating' session where programme participants asked questions to our team in support of the development of their projects.
