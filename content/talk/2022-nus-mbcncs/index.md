abstract: I was invited by Prof L Roman Carrasco to give a guest lecture for his postgraduate students taking the BL5323 module (Spatial Modeling in Environmental Sustainability) under the Master of Science in Biodiversity Conservation and Nature-based Climate Solutions (MBCNCS) Programme at National University of Singapore. My talk was about the application of LIDAR remote sensing for forest carbon mapping and monitoring.
