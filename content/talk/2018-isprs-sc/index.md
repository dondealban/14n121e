abstract: For this lecture, I shared about my on-going research on understanding land-system change dynamics in Myanmar, specifically about a newly-developed protocol for investigating land-system regime shifts, on combining optical and radar satellite data for land cover classification and change detection. I also demonstrated a flavor of Google Earth Engineâ€˜s many applications, particularly for land-system change studies.
