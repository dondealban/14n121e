The process was on and off during the past months, and although I found tips online that you can indeed complete it in a day or less, I only found time to on it very intermittently, mostly while in transit at airport terminals and during flights and over weekends, which was why it took about three months to finally deploy the sitein early February finally! My website is still incomplete and still under reconstruction, with most of my old blog posts and pages from my old 14n121e website to be slowly incorporated in my new website slowly. So please continue to watch this space!\nBelow, I have put together some guidance on how I rebuilt my new website with these new tools, specifically the ensemble of Hugo, R blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify, which you may find helpful in case you were wondering how you could go about building one for yourself too. I tried to put together the major steps with as much detail as I can recall, albeit I may have missed minor ones.\nPrerequisites. After some prior searching online, I settled on using Hugo, R blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify as the combination of tools/resources I would employ for rebuilding my website. Note that I did not mind reconstructing the site manually (e.g., migrating contents such as blog post one by one) because it was not alot and also because I wanted understand the inner workings, hence I did not pursue (semi-)automated ways that existed for migrating content from Wordpress to the new site. To get started, I ensured the following online accounts were set up and the software tools were installed in my Mac OSX machine:\n Git and a GitHub account as the version control system for tracking the changes in a dedicated repository containing the website contents; R and RStudio, the premier IDE for R, plus the blogdown R package developed by Yihue Xie; Then, Hugo, an open-source static site generator for building websites, plus the Academic Hugo theme by George Cushen, of which was my personal choice for the theme given its simple and customisable functions using the Markdown markup language (and it is apt for academics/scientists/researchers); In addition, I used some advanced features including Disqus to enable comments and discussions, and Google Analytics to understand my website traffic; and Finally, a Netlify account to enable a fast and continuous deployment of the website, once the GitHub repository was connected and the build settings were added.  Note that for most of the above, I already had prexisting registered accounts and had installed the tools, except for Netlify (so I had to sign up for a new account) and R blogdown and Hugo (both of which I had to newly install). So now let\u0026rsquo;s get started:\n1. Setting up Git and GitHub, and creating a repository on Github. Follow these instructions to help you install Git on your machine and setup GitHub, and once you have them both, create a repository that is located remotely on GitHub and cloned locally on your machine, which will be linked to Netlify later on so that any new content you generate in your repository gets dynamically updated on your website via Netlify.\n2. Installing blogdown, Hugo, and the Academic theme. First install R and RStudio, in case you do not have these locally on your machine yet. Once you have completed that step, you can install the blogdown R package and Hugo in RStudio using the following commands:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) blogdown::install_hugo(version = \u0026quot;0.63.1\u0026quot;, force = TRUE)  Using the Terminal, you can find out the installed version of Hugo on your machine via:\nhugo version  Also, check if your config.toml is found in the root of your project repository. Finally, you are ready to create a new site and serve it locally on your browser by using the following commands in RStudio:\nblogdown::new_site(theme=\u0026quot;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026quot;) blogdown:::serve_site()  Tada! You now have a new site and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to move on to personalising your website. More information on installing blogdown, Hugo, and the Academic theme can be found here with specific instructions for installing via RStudio here.\n3. Customising your website. You\u0026rsquo;ll find more guidance about personalising your website, especially with the way you want it by following these Getting Started instructions. As a start, the first main items you need to modify are the following:\n /config.toml, where you can change your site name, base URL (say with your own domain, or with a free one from Netlify), copyright display, and other advanced options; /config/_default/menus.toml, where you can change the names and the sequence of the menu links displayed on the navigation bar at the top of your homepage; /config/_default/params.toml, where you can customise your theme, modify your basic info (such as your website type, displaying a bespoke logo on your navigation bar), site details, contact details, social networks for sharing, and other regional and advanced options. You can configure your comments (e.g., Disqus), search, maps, and marketing (i.e., Google Analytics) via the params.toml; /config/_default/languages.toml, where you can configure another language to provide language options for your visitors/readers; and finally, /content/authors/admin/_index.md, where you can modify your biographical sketch and tell people who you are. In the same folder place a photo of yourself (called avatar.jpg) to display your profile photo or avatar.  You can implement so many other neat customisations, including customising your theme colours and fonts; choosing your website icon (or favicon); enabling Google Analytics to understand your website traffic; enabling comments or discussions for your content such as by using Disqus; selecting your social networks (e.g., Twitter) for page sharing, and many more.\nOne of the main customisations that I wanted to do was displaying Altmetric badges for each of my publication pages. Following available instructions, I created a file called custom_js.html in the following folder /layouts/partials/ under the root directory of your repository, which had the following contents:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  The above script was copied from Altmetric\u0026rsquo;s guidance for embedding their badges. And then, include the following code at the end of the body of your publication post. I did this for each of my publications that had an Altmetric page and modified the DOI accordingly.\n\u0026lt;div data-badge-details=\u0026quot;right\u0026quot; data-badge-type=\u0026quot;medium-donut\u0026quot; data-doi=\u0026quot;10.1088/1748-9326/ab666d\u0026quot; data-hide-no-mentions=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;altmetric-embed\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Once you have set this up, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the Altmetric badge with its details similar to the one below. Customising the Altmetric badge to your linking is easy and you can follow these instructions.\n 4. Deploying your website using Netlify. Finally, it is time to deploy your website for free on Netlify. To create your new website, first, you need to choose and connect to your Git provider (in this case GitHub) where your site\u0026rsquo;s source code is hosted for continuous deployment. That means when you push to Git, Netlify runs your build tool of choice on their servers and deploys the result. Then, pick the repository where your site\u0026rsquo;s source code is located. Finally, build and deploy! Although I only used a free Netlify account, you can add a custom domain for your site if you prefer. Concluding Remarks. You will definitely spend a good amount of time customising your site, particularly during the initialisation stage. But once you have most of your site elements and pages completed, updating becomes much easier. For example, I create new content exclusively in RStudio, such as a new blog post, a recent publication, or news item. This means that when I save the files and once I am ready to deploy the new content to my wesbite, I instantiate a commit of the recent changes and push the changes to the public repository of my website. And since this repository is dynamically linked to Netlify, new content or any changes get deployed automatically on my website via Netlify.\nAs a final note, I have to say that the initial setup required some effort and time to learn a few new tools—and troubleshoot as required—but in the end, I was satisfied with the process and the outcome, and also from knowing that from here on the upkeep required to maintain my online presence would be minimal.\nAcknowledgements. I used several resources online including instructions of how to use Hugo, blogdown, and Netlify, which of note were the helpful and easy-to-follow instructions from Yihue Xie for blogdown and George Cushen for the Academic theme for Hugo. I\u0026rsquo;ve benefitted alot from reading blog posts, especially getting up and running with blogdown and a week of blogdown by Alison Hill; building my website with blogdown by Katie Scranton; how to make your own website for free for under and hour by Dan Quintana; creating a website with the Academic theme in blogdown by Kevin Zolea; and tips for using the Academic theme by Leslie Myint. I also found bits of inspiration about the content possibilities of using the Hugo Academic theme from the bespoke designs of the websites of Erika Fille Legara, Zhi Yang, Daniel Quintana, Alison Hill, and Leslie Myint, which were all super helpful.\nSpecial thanks to Lloyd Zapanta for developing a true type font for the Baybayin script, which is the indigenous alphabet writing script of pre-colonial Philippines. He designed several true type fonts of the Baybayin script, of which I particularly used Baybayin Sisil rendition for creating my website logo, which is essentially my written name in Baybayin to express my ethnic roots.\n","date":1583250000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583250600,"objectID":"8ce18799cd5b469030d9c73be19817fb","permalink":"/post/2020/03-07-rebuilding-my-website-with-github-hugo-blogdown-netlify/","publishdate":"2020-03-03T15:40:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020/03-07-rebuilding-my-website-with-github-hugo-blogdown-netlify/","section":"post","summary":"Image source: mikeyharper.uk\nI rebuilt my personal website from scratch using a static site generator, first, because I wanted a cleaner and streamlined site with an easy upkeep, plus I was motivated to learn the new tools, and more importantly, to move away from hosting on Wordpress due to the really annoying ads.

As it may no longer be economically viable to continue to tap rubber in many cases, especially if labor outside the household is hired, there is therefore a need to study how household agricultural diversification relates to land use and land cover change.\nOne scenario may be that households opt to cut down their rubber plantations to be replaced with a potentially more profitable crop on the same plot of land. (Note that rubber plantations are regarded as forest cover by governments and FAO—and this counts as deforestation or forest loss.) Another scenario may be that, if a land frontier still exists, households may instead (or in addition to) decide to open new forest land to plant an alternative crop to rubber, resulting in forest loss in the general vicinity of the existing rubber plantations.\nFor this project, I am implementing remote sensing image analysis of time-series Landsat 30m (2000–2018/9) in identified sites to capture changes in forest cover and land use during the rubber boom (2000s) and during the rubber slump (2010s). This analysis complements the household interviews in targeted villages in selected townships conducted by local research collaborators that intend to capture household decision-making on their responses to the market downturn, political economic forces, and land tenure regimes underpinning any direct and indirect drivers of land use/cover change.\nThis project also complements our ongoing MoE-funded Tier 1 project that intends to develop spatially explicit predictive models using cellular automata of future land change trajectories in Southeast Asia.\n","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"afb1e968081a59774fd8c7f955efba10","permalink":"/project/06_rubber-dynamics/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/06_rubber-dynamics/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the new deforestation dynamics of rubber in mainland Southeast Asia.","tags":["Cambodia","deforestation","forest degradation","household interviews","land use/land cover change","Myanmar","remote sensing","rubber","Southeast Asia"],"title":"Understanding New Deforestation Drivers of Rubber in Mainland Southeast Asia.","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jose Don T De Alban"],"categories":["Research","Resources"],"content":"I have been sharing the coding materials and resources related to my research on my GitHub page but I have not had the chance to blog about these here at all, even briefly.

Anyway\u0026hellip;\nFirst, the repositories that accompany some of my published papers, either those I have led or had the great opportunity to co-author. I put together these materials to supplement the published papers, thereby creating a backup of the materials used and developed through the study such as data, results, scripts, and figures. By doing this, I was aiming to encourage not just other scientists and researchers but also my future self to do better science by fostering research reproducibility and transparency. It also improves the overall impact of my own research. Some of these repositories include materials for my 2018 Remote Sensing and 2019 Sustainability papers, as well as a 2017 Conservation Biology paper, all of which were done together with my lab members and principal investigator.\nSecond, I\u0026rsquo;ve created some repositories over the last couple of years for a lecture I gave at the ISPRS Student Consortium Summer School and Hackathon in 2018 where I shared about my land change research and ran a crash course on Google Earth Engine, and a short tutorial on species distribution modeling using MaxEnt and R that I did for my labmates during a lab retreat in 2017.\nFinally, I\u0026rsquo;ve also developed a couple of long how-to guides or tutorials while I was starting to learn some R packages in pursuit of my research ideas. There was one on the stm package on structural topic modeling for text data mining and automated content analysis; and the other on the intensity analysis package, which has been a key component of my research on land use/cover change analysis.\nQuite frankly, I am stoked to see that users on GitHub have found these repositories (and some others I have not mentioned) useful as indicated by the number of stars or forks (take the learning-stm repo, for example).\nPlease do watch my GitHub space for more updates on my research activities.

My poster presentation was about our study on investigating land-cover regime shifts by integrating complementary analytical frameworks in the Tanintharyi Region, southern Myanmar, which was published earlier this year in a special issue of Sustainability journal (full paper here). I have not done a poster presentation in a very long while\u0026mdash;my last one was back in 2004, if my memory serves me right\u0026mdash;and so this time around it was an immensely gratifying experience, particularly seeing how other scientists were genuinely interested in what we found, how they thought of using the approaches and results of our study to build on their own work, as well as providing constructive feedback. Actually, I even won, to my utmost surprise, the 3rd best poster award out of about 50 posters presented during the meeting!\nI am starting to think I prefer doing poster presentations now better than oral presentations simply because the posters get to stay on display for the duration of the meeting and the people who engage and interact with you during poster sessions, in my opinion, are those who are really interested in your work or have the same research interests as you. In oral presentations, of which I\u0026rsquo;ve done much more frequently in the past, you would usually only have a short amount of time to present your study, and more often than not, hardly enough time is available at the end of your talk for questions or meaningful discussions with the audience. During the meeting\u0026rsquo;s plenary discussion, one of the main suggestions for future meetings was to have more poster presentations and less oral presentations, of which I am delighted about and of which I think should be the better way moving forward.\nThere were also some insightful and interesting talks during the oral keynote presentation sessions. Of note were talks by:\n Thuy Le Toan (CESBIO, France) who presented about the BIOMASS Mission, the first ever P-band SAR sensor planned to be launched in space by 2022 to observe tropical forests. The BIOMASS mission is a truly exciting project because it will allow scientists to answer what the role of forests are in the global carbon cycle, and this time with less uncertainty in measurements by utilising SAR tomography; and\n Jeffrey Fox (East-West Center, USA) who talked about his long-term research on the expansion of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and its implications for water, carbon, and livelihoods across montane mainland Southeast Asia. After his talk, it got me into thinking: with rubber prices currently really low, what would happen to existing rubber plantations? Would these rubber plantations be converted into other plantations with more lucrative agricultural commodities (like oil palm) so that the plantation owners/farmers can profit from their investments? If not, would it potentially open new frontier areas of deforestation to make way for other lucrative plantations that would then serve as an alternative source of income while at the same time keeping their rubber plantations (in wait until prices become more profitable again)?\n  Finally, it was a pleasure meeting other remote sensing and land change scientists and learning about their research work in the region and elsewhere. Some of them I\u0026rsquo;ve met for the first time (like Xiaobo, Haemi, Prakhar, Garrett), and some who I met in the last science meeting (like Hoa, Arai, Sumalika), and then Thuy whom I\u0026rsquo;ve known before during the ALOS K\u0026amp;C science meetings in Japan as well as Jeff who came to visit our lab in Singapore.\n","date":1564092720,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564092720,"objectID":"4d95a33d0b1ec830e1e473ae18bf2d47","permalink":"/post/2019/07-25-some-impressions-nasa-sari-lcluc-science-meeting/","publishdate":"2019-07-25T22:12:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019/07-25-some-impressions-nasa-sari-lcluc-science-meeting/","section":"post","summary":"I had the opportunity to present a poster at the international science meeting of the land cover / land use change (LCLUC) programme of NASA\u0026rsquo;s South/Southeast Asia Regional Initiative, held in Johor Bahru, Malaysia from 22nd to 24th of July 2019.

How do we make use of different satellite imageries and is it possible to develop a robust synergistic approach on mapping using remote sensing and GIS? This topic aims to explore which satellite imageries can be used in addressing scientific and societal issues and to develop a potential methodology on how to improve results through a synergistic mapping approach.\n Hence, this will give me the opportunity to talk about my on-going research on understanding land-system change dynamics in Myanmar, specifically my recent Remote Sensing paper on combining optical and radar data for land cover classification and change detection; and then, demonstrate a flavor of Google Earth Engine\u0026rsquo;s many applications, particularly to land-system change studies (which then gives me a good platform to share my research on a newly-developed protocol for investigating land-system regime shifts); plus a bit about the research projects I have done over the years under the ALOS Kyoto \u0026amp; Carbon Initiative with my former teammates at Fauna \u0026amp; Flora International, mainly on the synergistic use of optical and radar data for land cover (and mangrove) mapping and monitoring in the Philippines.\nWatch this space for more updates on next week\u0026rsquo;s Summer School activity.\n","date":1533305760,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533305760,"objectID":"48a8ff96725b07a825733cb009be8554","permalink":"/post/2018/08-03-motivate-learning/","publishdate":"2018-08-03T14:16:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018/08-03-motivate-learning/","section":"post","summary":"I am stoked to be one of the invited lecturers/visiting experts for next week\u0026rsquo;s MOTIVATE Learning activity, a collaborative project organised by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Student Consortium (ISPRS SC), the Geoinformatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) of Thailand, and the ASEAN Research and Training Center for Space Technology and Applications (ARTSA), which will be held at the Space Krenovation Park in Chonburi, Thailand.

I\u0026rsquo;ve come to learn in the course of my years of study and professional experience that mapmaking is not as easy as it seems. Maps tell a story. And for maps to effectively tell that story, the mapmaker should think not only about the main subject of the map, but should also give due consideration to the various map elements such as their position and balance across the map, as well as the accuracy of the measurements, and the styling of these elements which involve, for example, the choice of colors, line weights, among other considerations.\nTo be honest, although I\u0026rsquo;ve been making maps for my entire professional career, I have never considered color vision impairment in the design of maps, at least those that I have made myself. (For instance, the green and red color scheme that I consistently use to depict forest loss and forest gain would be the same shade of gray for a person with color vision impairment.) I have always kept in mind the psychology of colors in maps to help get the message across to the users of these maps, thereby allowing them to better understand the story that the map intends to tell. But unfortunately, I have not put myself in the shoes of a person with color blindness and have given enough thought on how they would perceive and understand those maps. At least not yet.\nThe opportunity to rectify this finally came in the process of finalising a map figure for the final proof of our recently accepted paper for publication. A colleague of mine, G, suggested that we consider designing the color scheme of the figure to be more friendly for color blind people. It was a brilliant suggestion. I had not thought of it at first (yet again) and I welcomed it because it gave me the chance to learn and design maps for both people with normal vision and color vision impairments.\nTo implement this, luckily an app called Color Oracle existed, which is a free color blindness simulator that can be used across computer platforms. It shows what people with common color vision impairments would see in real time, thus allowing a person to select appropriate colors in designing the color scheme of a material, website, or publication. Color Oracle basically applies a color filter over the full screen of your computer regardless of the software in use.\nFor example, the screenshots of the same portion of the map figure below was the result of the Color Oracle app showing me what a person with normal vision would see and what a color vision impaired person would see. Through these color filters, I then selected colors that would ensure the images can be read by people with normal vision and color blindness. It adds another layer of consideration in designing maps, even making it more challenging, but this ensures that the map can be read by and be accessible to the widest possible audience.\nScreenshots of the same portion of a map figure showing the colors that people with normal color vision would see (leftmost image) and the colors that people with color vision impairments would see, particularly those with deuteranopia (2nd from left), protanopia (3rd from left), and tritanopia (rightmost image).\nFor additional reading, visit the Color Oracle website and read the papers by Jenny \u0026amp; Kelso (2007a, 2007b) to learn more about the design of information graphics and maps that are accessible for color-impaired readers.\nReferences:\nJenny, B., Kelso, N.

The overarching objective of this project is to understand and evaluate the drivers of land use change and deforestation in Myanmar, and to increase the resilience of protected areas to protect biodiversity in the face of rapid new pressures imposed by increased foreign direct investment. This project intends to combine local case studies, geospatial modelling tools, and policy analyses to inform the fluid policy context of Myanmar and generate novel insights for long-term conservation and management of biodiversity by improving land use planning, protected area management, and improving policy tools for environmental safeguarding. A spatially-explicit, hierarchical approach to this problem is pursued through the following three inter-related objectives:\n Broad, country-wide analysis to evaluate land-use change scenarios based on present and future agricultural productivity, commodity prices and forest rents. This objective is done by generating top-down, macro-economic land rent models that utilize national and global-level data and creating scenarios based on expected future economic opportunities.\n Local, case-study analysis to understand how individual actors might behave when given new agricultural opportunities associated with increased investment. This objective is achieved by developing bottom-up agent-based models integrating local perception data, to predict areas most vulnerable to deforestation and land use change surrounding a subset of priority protected areas.\n Develop policy recommendations that reconcile increased international investment, new opportunities for livelihood improvement through agricultural expansion and intensification, with biodiversity conservation in Myanmar. This objective includes the conduct of scenario analyses of the models constructed for 1) and 2) above, based on present conditions and potential policy options.
