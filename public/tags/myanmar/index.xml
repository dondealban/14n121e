      <title>Understanding New Deforestation Drivers of Rubber in Mainland Southeast Asia.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNDERSTANDING NEW DRIVERS OF DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA: SMALLHOLDER LIVELIHOOD DIVERSIFICATION AND VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS FOR RUBBER WOOD AND LATEX (2019—2020).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am collaborating with &lt;a href=&#34;https://kevinwoods.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Kevin Woods&lt;/a&gt; who is the lead principal investigator of this project funded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forest-trends.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Forest Trends&lt;/a&gt; on investigating the new indirect drivers of deforestation and forest degradation related to rubber’s bust cycle in mainland Southeast Asia, specifically in Cambodia and Myanmar. As it may no longer be economically viable to continue to tap rubber in many cases, especially if labor outside the household is hired, there is therefore a need to study how household agricultural diversification relates to land use and land cover change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One scenario may be that households opt to cut down their rubber plantations to be replaced with a potentially more profitable crop on the same plot of land. (Note that rubber plantations are regarded as forest cover by governments and FAO—and this counts as deforestation or forest loss.) Another scenario may be that, if a land frontier still exists, households may instead (or in addition to) decide to open new forest land to plant an alternative crop to rubber, resulting in forest loss in the general vicinity of the existing rubber plantations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, I am implementing remote sensing image analysis of time-series Landsat 30m (2000–2018/9) in identified sites to capture changes in forest cover and land use during the rubber boom (2000s) and during the rubber slump (2010s). This analysis complements the household interviews in targeted villages in selected townships conducted by local research collaborators that intend to capture household decision-making on their responses to the market downturn, political economic forces, and land tenure regimes underpinning any direct and indirect drivers of land use/cover change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project also complements our ongoing &lt;a href=&#34;https://dondealban.netlify.com/project/05_beyond-deforestation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MoE-funded Tier 1 project&lt;/a&gt; that intends to develop spatially explicit predictive models using cellular automata of future land change trajectories in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reconciling Agricultural Expansion and Forest Conservation in Myanmar.</title>
      <link>/project/04_myanmar-tier2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECONCILING AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION AND FOREST CONSERVATION IN THE NEW MYANMAR (2016-2019).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s rapid socio-economic transition presents a unique opportunity to study the influence of economic development on biodiversity conservation in the context of governance transformation. The overarching objective of this project is to understand and evaluate the drivers of land use change and deforestation in Myanmar, and to increase the resilience of protected areas to protect biodiversity in the face of rapid new pressures imposed by increased foreign direct investment. This project intends to combine local case studies, geospatial modelling tools, and policy analyses to inform the fluid policy context of Myanmar and generate novel insights for long-term conservation and management of biodiversity by improving land use planning, protected area management, and improving policy tools for environmental safeguarding. A spatially-explicit, hierarchical approach to this problem is pursued through the following three inter-related objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad, country-wide analysis to evaluate land-use change scenarios based on present and future agricultural productivity, commodity prices and forest rents.&lt;/strong&gt; This objective is done by generating top-down, macro-economic land rent models that utilize national and global-level data and creating scenarios based on expected future economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local, case-study analysis to understand how individual actors might behave when given new agricultural opportunities associated with increased investment.&lt;/strong&gt; This objective is achieved by developing bottom-up agent-based models integrating local perception data, to predict areas most vulnerable to deforestation and land use change surrounding a subset of priority protected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop policy recommendations that reconcile increased international investment, new opportunities for livelihood improvement through agricultural expansion and intensification, with biodiversity conservation in Myanmar.&lt;/strong&gt; This objective includes the conduct of scenario analyses of the models constructed for 1) and 2) above, based on present conditions and potential policy options. This should lead to science-based policy recommendations related to infrastructure investment, agricultural expansion, protected area conservation and environmental safeguards based on realistic scenarios going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Conceptualising and Articulating the Drivers of Deforestation in Myanmar.</title>
      <link>/project/03_myanmar-tier1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCEPTUALISING AND ARTICULATING THE DRIVERS OF DEFORESTATION IN THE NEW MYANMAR (2015–2018).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project intends to develop a conceptual framework for Myanmar that distinguishes and identifies the various stakeholders, resources, and their relationships set within the dynamic policy landscape. Moreover, the project intends to develop a holistic, multi-disciplinary perspective on the emerging trends in Myanmar that are likely to have an impact on the forest-agriculture interface. The two specific objectives of the project are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop a qualitative conceptual framework that identifies, describes, and links key
stakeholders that influence forest conservation, agriculture, and natural resource extraction in Myanmar, and embeds those relationships within a socio-economic and policy context. The framework should describe the stakeholders, agents, and contextual factors that will later inform scenario analysis for a spatially-explicit, top-down, rent-based agriculture-forest model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To conduct a horizon scan that identifies the highest priority threats and opportunities that Myanmar’s increased international engagement will have for forest conservation. This will lead to novel, interdisciplinary insights on how Myanmar’s new international engagement may lead to new physical outcomes, such as agricultural intensification, deforestation, or agroindustrial expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
